===== DNMM Pilot Briefing =====

Pilots taking part in events that depart from or arrive to DNMM should make themselves familiar with this briefing page as well as with all existing charts.

==== Overview ====

==== Departure Briefing ====

  * When connecting to the network, take care in observing which gates and parking positions are available.

=== Departure Timeline ===

  * For Cross Africa, your slot time is represented as a CTOT (Calculated Take off Time).
  * You'll be expected to push-back at TOBT (Target Off Block Time) between 15 and 20 minutes before CTOT (depending on how the traffic is flowing at that time).
  * As far as Clearance is concerned, you can request it at any time before TOBT, as long as you'll be ready for push-back at TOBT. We suggest you request your clearance at least 15 minutes before TOBT.
  * You should not need to connect to the network more than 60 minutes before your CTOT.


=== Clearance Delivery ===

  * DNMM_GND will be the Position responsible for providing you with a Departure Clearance.
  * You may be given a Runway Heading as a Departure Procedure.
  * If you're parked East of runway 18L, you will depart from runway 18L. If parked at the Main International Apron, you will depart runway 18R.


=== Ground Operations ===

  * DNMM_GND will be the Position responsible for providing push-back and taxiing instructions.
  * Remember to squawk Mode C before taxiing.
  * If told to monitor a frequency, you're expected to tune in the frequency but not to contact the controller. He will contact you when able.
  * When approaching the runway, you'll be asked to report fully ready for departure. That means that when given line-up or take-off clearance, you're expected to be ready to do so without delay. If you need more time, please advise the tower.

=== Departure Operations ===

  * Comply with your assigned departure procedure and do not climb above your initial Climb Altitude unless instructed so.
  * You may be given intermediate climb instructions due to traffic. Do not climb above any assigned flight level.
  * Comply with any speed restrictions if provided. They are important to maintain adequate separation between traffic.
  * You may be transferred from Tower directly to Accra Control. That's ok.


===== Arrival Briefing =====
=== Arrivals and Approaches ===
  * As your flight is approaching DNMM, please make yourself familiar with the arrival and approach procedures for Nairobi.
  * All pilots to expect Runway 18L or 18R for landing. For Cross Africa, we'll be using Runway 18R to land, expect the **ILS**.
  * Pilots should plan for the BUDSI1N arrival, landing for Runway 18R.
  * On initial contact with Kano, you will be told the landing runway and the arrival.

=== Landing ===
  * When landings, pilots are advised to vacate as quickly as possible to allow for smooth operation.
  * If a pilot vacates via A3 or A4, continue taxi via A, no further than F.
  * If needed, Tower will taxi no further than F, before being handed off to Ground for stand allocation.
