===== DNMM Departure =====

  * DNMM doesn't have a dedicated Departure Position, with Lagos Approach (DNMM APP) assuming the role of Departure.


==== Departure Procedures ====

  * All aircraft are required to fly the assigned SID given by ATC. Controllers may issue continuous climb instructions to FL150. Further climb instructions may be issued to FL250 if no controller is above or other FL if coordinated prior.


==== Coordinating DNIB Departures ====

  * All departures departing out of DNIB shall be given runway heading with an initial climb of FL050.
  * Departures out of DNIB to the north should be sent to DNMM/ DNKK_CTR.
