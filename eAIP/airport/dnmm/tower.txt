===== DNMM Tower =====

  * Lagos (DNMM) is not certified for neither parallel or simultaneous approach procedures. Standard separation must be maintained.

==== Runway Selection ====

  * The preferred runways at DNMM are 18L and 18R as there are no Instrument Approaches for the 36s. 
  * Runway 18R is the longer runway and the preferred arrival and departure runway for Heavy aircraft. 
  * It is also the preferred arrival and departure runway for traffic headed to the Cargo and International Aprons. 
  * Runway 18L is the preferred arrival and departure runway for traffic headed to the Domestic, GA and FBO Aprons.


==== Runway Change Operations ====

  * Runway changes must be coordinate with existing DEL, GND, TWR, DEP and APP controllers.
  * If possible, hold aircraft on stand before a runway change operation.
  * If an aircraft is already taxying on Twy F, offer the pilot the option to use the existing active Rwy or to enter the runway for taxiway direction change.
  * If an aircraft as already passed an approach IAF fix, an APP or TWR controller should advise the pilot of the possibility of a runway change prior to the aircraft being on the final approach segment.
